 ; about .pack :
 ; Generally this method should not be called in an actor's constructor because it calls Layout.layout(), which means a subclass would have layout() called before the subclass' constructor. Instead, in constructors simply set the actor's size to Layout.getPrefWidth() and Layout.getPrefHeight(). This allows the actor to have a size at construction time for more convenient use with groups that do not layout their children.
